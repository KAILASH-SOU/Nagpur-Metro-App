# Nagpur-Metro-App

The Nagpur Metro Navigation System is a command-line application that simulates real-time metro route planning for the Nagpur Metro. It uses real-world station data from the Orange and Aqua lines, allowing users to:

List all stations in the network

View the full metro map with interconnections

Find the shortest distance or fastest route between two stations

Calculate estimated travel time with interchanges

The system uses Dijkstra’s algorithm for route optimization and a custom heap implementation for efficient priority handling — all in C++.
